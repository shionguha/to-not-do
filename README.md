to-not-do
=========

A list of things I'd love to do but should not do until (a) my to-do list is
complete or (b) it is before ~9am on a Saturday.

Organized thusly:

- [personal/home](./personal-home.md)
- [crunch](./crunch.md)
- [work](./work.md)

Not to be confused with mid/long-term goals I'm actually pursuing: mine are
listed on the wonderful [accompl.sh][accomplsh].

Idea to maintain a 'to not do' list thanks to [Jofish Kaye][jofish] and [Phil Adams][philadams].
